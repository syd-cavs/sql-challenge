# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I used pgAdmin to read the six csv files related to the Employee data.  I used an ERD to help myself visualize the connections.  The link to this ERD is in the file listed as 'ERD.md' as well as a screenshotted image available in the images folder.  The creation of the tables is listed in the SQL_Codes folder and the file it is in is labeled as Tables.sql.
After defining and establishing connections within the tables, data analysis was ready to be performed.  This analysis can be found under the SQL_Codes folder as well and the file it is in is labeled as Queries.sql.  The original prompts for which data to look for are included in this document.
I opted to not complete the bonus this time around fearing a late homework submission.
